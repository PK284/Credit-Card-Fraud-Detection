# Credit Card Fraud Detection
 This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time. The model is trained on a dataset of anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, and uses various features such as transaction amount, location, and time to make predictions.
